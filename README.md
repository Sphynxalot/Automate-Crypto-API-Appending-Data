# Automate-Crypto-API-Appending-Data

This file contains the full path I took in importing an API from CoinMarketCap, appending data, and a brief touch on data visualisation in Python.<br>
Different Data Frames were created to show the different paths I took with the data so you can get a true view of start to finish.<br>
This project could be used to track change in Cryptocurrencies automatically to inform investors.
